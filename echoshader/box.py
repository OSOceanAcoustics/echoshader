def get_box_stream(source_pic, bounds: tuple = None):
    """
    Get a Holoviews BoundsXY stream for a source plot with optional default bounds.

    This function creates a Holoviews BoundsXY stream for the specified `source_pic`,
    which is a Holoviews plot object. The `BoundsXY` stream allows users to interactively
    select a rectangular region on the plot by dragging a box with their mouse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_pic : holoviews.element
        The source plot for which the BoundsXY stream will be created.
    bounds : tuple, optional
        The initial default bounds of the selected rectangular region (box).
        If not provided, the default bounds are set to the left, bottom, right,
        and top corners of the `source_pic` plot.

    Returns
    -------
    holoviews.streams.BoundsXY
        A Holoviews BoundsXY stream associated with the `source_pic` plot.
        The stream allows users to interactively select a rectangular region (box)
        on the plot and get the selected bounds as an output.

    Examples
    --------
    # Assuming source_pic is a Holoviews plot object (e.g., hvplot.Image or hvplot.Scatter)

    box_stream = get_box_stream(source_pic, bounds=custom_bounds)

    # The box_stream can be used to interactively select a rectangular region (box)
    # on the plot and access the selected bounds.
    # For example, you can access the bounds using:
    # bounds = box_stream.bounds
    # where bounds is a tuple containing the selected (left, bottom, right, top) coordinates.

    """
    Get a Holoviews Lasso stream for a source plot with optional default geometry.

    This function creates a Holoviews Lasso stream for the specified `source_pic`,
    which is a Holoviews plot object. The `Lasso` stream allows users to interactively
    draw free-form polygonal shapes (lasso) on the plot using their mouse.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_pic : holoviews.element
        The source plot for which the Lasso stream will be created.
    geometry : numpy.array, optional
        The initial default geometry of the lasso shape as an Nx2 NumPy array.
        The array should contain a list of (x, y) coordinate pairs forming the
        vertices of the lasso shape. If not provided, a default lasso shape will
        be set using the left, bottom, right, and top corners of the `source_pic` plot.

    Returns
    -------
    holoviews.streams.Lasso
        A Holoviews Lasso stream associated with the `source_pic` plot.
        The stream allows users to interactively draw lasso shapes on the plot
        and get the drawn lasso geometry as an output.

    Examples
    --------
