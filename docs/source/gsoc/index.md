Hey there! Welcome to the Echoshader Google Summer of Code page.

For 2022 we collaborated with the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) to recruit talented contributors under the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program!

This project aims to enhance the capability to interactively visualize large volumes of cloud-based ocean sonar data to accelerate the data exploration and discovery process. The project will go hand-in-hand with ongoing development of the echopype package that handles the standardization, pre-processing, and organization of these data.
