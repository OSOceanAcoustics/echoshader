# Version 0.1.0

This version is contributed by [Dingrui Lei](https://github.com/ldr426).

It implements echogram, track, and curtain plots, histogram and stats generation functionalities, and their interactive linking.

For this version, the Echoshader class acts as the controller that handles user interactions through widgets, triggers the necessary data updates, and updates the view accordingly. It achieves this through the use of callbacks and stream methods provided by libraries like Holoviews and Panel.

You can read more on the design structure in the next section or skip directly to the visualization examples in the follow up sections.
