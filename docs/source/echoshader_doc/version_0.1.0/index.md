# Version 0.1.0

This version is contributed by [Dingrui Lei](https://github.com/ldr426).

For this version, the Echoshader class acts as the controller that handles user interactions through widgets, triggers the necessary data updates, and updates the view accordingly. It achieves this through the use of callbacks and stream methods provided by libraries like Holoviews and Panel.
